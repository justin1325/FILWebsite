FILWebsite
==========
This was a Web Programming project that spanned 4 weeks to create a website to bolster the already existent SCU Frugal
Innovation website. It may or may not have features that are used on the actual FIL website in the future. The website was
worked on by 2 students with further information to be found in the team members readme. The code is admittedly extremely
messy and probably unoptomized however as this was an introduction to Web Programming class it is the first website that
both of us had created
